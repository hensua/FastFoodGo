/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the FastFoodGo application.
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset enforces a multi-role security model for a food delivery app,
 * catering to Customers, Drivers, and Admins. The rules are designed for
 * rapid prototyping, focusing on strict authorization while maintaining
 * flexibility in data schemas.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is built on strict data ownership and role-based access.
 * Customers have complete control over their personal data tree, drivers manage
 * their own profiles, and admins have global oversight. Publicly accessible
 * data, like the product catalog, is read-only for regular users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /customers/{userId}/...: A user-specific data tree containing a customer's
 *   profile, orders, and order-specific data. This structure ensures that a
 *   user's private information is securely isolated by path.
 * - /products/{productId}: A top-level collection for the public menu.
 * - /drivers/{driverId}: A top-level collection for driver profiles.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: A restricted collection where the existence of a
 *   document grants a user administrative privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Data Isolation: All customer-related data is nested under `/customers/{userId}`,
 *   allowing for simple and highly secure path-based ownership rules. Listing
 *   other users' data is impossible for non-admins.
 * - Admin Privileges: Admin access is granted via Document-Based Access Control
 *   (DBAC) in the `/roles_admin` collection. This collection is write-protected
 *   by security rules and must be managed from a trusted server environment.
 * - Driver Access: Drivers can only manage their own profile in `/drivers/{driverId}`.
 *   They are granted read-only access to specific orders across different users
 *   if their `driverId` is present on the order document. They cannot list or
 *   modify orders.
 * - Public Data: The `/products` collection is publicly readable by anyone but
 *   can only be modified by admins.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Order` document contains a `customerId` field. On creation, this field
 *   is validated against the user's authenticated UID to securely establish
 *   ownership.
 * - The `Order` document also contains a `driverId` field. This allows a simple
 *   rule to grant a specific driver read access to that order without needing slow
 *   or impossible cross-collection queries.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data (`/customers`) is structurally separated from public data
 *   (`/products`) and role-specific data (`/drivers`). This segregation simplifies
 *   rules for list operations, making queries safer and more performant.
