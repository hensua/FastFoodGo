/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the FastFoodGo application.
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset implements a multi-role security model for a food delivery app,
 * catering to Customers, Drivers, Hosts, and Admins. It prioritizes strict
 * authorization through path-based ownership and role-checking.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * - Customer Data Privacy: A user's personal data (profile, orders) is stored
 *   in a private subcollection under `/users/{userId}`, accessible only by them
 *   or an admin.
 * - Role-Based Access: Admin, Host, and Driver roles grant specific permissions.
 *   - Admins have god-mode access, managed via a separate `/roles_admin` collection
 *     for security and performance.
 *   - Hosts can view all orders to manage the kitchen but have limited write access.
 *   - Drivers can only read orders specifically assigned to them.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role Segregation: Admin status is granted by a document's existence in
 *   `/roles_admin/{userId}`. This is a robust pattern that avoids complex `get()`
 *   calls in other rules, preventing recursive permission issues.
 * - Explicit List Operations: Listing documents (e.g., all users or all orders
 *   from a specific user) is explicitly granted only to appropriate roles (admin/host).
 *   Unrestricted `collectionGroup` queries are implicitly denied unless explicitly
 *   allowed.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: Order documents contain `customerId` and
 *   `driverId`. This denormalization allows security rules to grant access without
 *   needing slow or insecure cross-collection `get()` calls.
